## Microsoft Bubbles Screensaver Clone in OpenGL 3/4+ and C/C++

OpenGL Game/3D Engine written in C++, OpenGL 4+ (currently 3 but its the same) and GLSL.

A 3D Engine cant really exist unless it does something so this one clones the Microsoft Bubbles Screensaver.

This program was a milestone that later became a much larger full-fledged Tai Chi Simulator that also used <openvr.h> to make it an actual SteamVR Game (see [justinbentley.dev#VRTaiChi](https://justinbentley.dev/#VRTaiChi)).

In its current state (and this is a really early build) its stable and useable but it needs a lot of refinement, I plan on working on it a bit (sometime).

You can see a video of it running [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XdwpFVK98&list=PLoexzHtl62yWyu0h-OItQpDZCHwT4CqGm&index=10) (dont forget to like and subscribe ðŸ˜ƒ).

Massive, massive credits to [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno) and his [OpenGL Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) on youtube for if not for that this may not of become a reality (most other guides were pretty bad) and I would of failed my specialized University Final Project!

How did VR Tai Chi score? 100/100 and it really brought a smile to my Professors face, for context we were all taught Legacy OpenGL and everyone thought Modern OpenGL (this) too hard, let alone OpenVR (which actually was hard). 

## Dependencies  
This project includes all necessary third-party libraries in the repository.
These dependancies are:
* glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN64
* glew-2.1.0
* glm-0.9.9.4 (only root\glm included as GLM), what can i say i was a uni student?
* Bitmap.h v1.2.1 â€“ By Benjamin Kalytta (2006â€“2007)  

These are bundled to ensure compatibility, especially since some are no longer be easily available.

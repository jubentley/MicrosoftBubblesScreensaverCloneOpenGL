OpenGL Game/3D Engine written in C++, OpenGL 4+ (currently 3 but its the same) and GLSL.

A 3D Engine cant really exist unless it does something so this one clones the Microsoft Bubbles Screensaver.

This program was a milestone that later became a much bigger Tai Chi Simulator that also used <openvr.h> to make playable through SteamVR (see https://justinbentley.dev/#VRTaiChi)

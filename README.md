## Microsoft Bubbles Screensaver Clone in OpenGL 3/4+ and C/C++

OpenGL Game/3D Engine written in C++, OpenGL 4+ (currently 3 but its the same) and GLSL.

A 3D Engine cant really exist unless it does something so this one clones the Microsoft Bubbles Screensaver.

This program was a milestone that later became a much larger full-fledged Tai Chi Simulator that also used <openvr.h> to make it an actual SteamVR Game (see [justinbentley.dev#VRTaiChi](https://justinbentley.dev/#VRTaiChi)).

In its current state (and this is a really early build) its stable and useable but it needs a lot of refinement.

Massive, massive credits to [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno) and his [OpenGL Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) on youtube for if not for that this may not of become a reality (most other guides were pretty bad) and I would of failed my specialized University Final Project!

OpenGL Game/3D Engine written in C++, OpenGL 4+ (currently 3 but its the same) and GLSL.

A 3D Engine cant really exist unless it does something so this one clones the Microsoft Bubbles Screensaver.

This program was a milestone that later became a much larger full-fledged Tai Chi Simulator that also used <openvr.h> to make it an actual SteamVR Game (see <a>href="https://justinbentley.dev/#VRTaiChi" justinbentley.dev#VRTaiChi<a/>).

In its current state (and this is a really early build) its stable and useable but it needs a lot of refinement.

Massive, massive credits to @TheCherno and his OpenGL series on youtube for if not for that this may not of become a reality and I would of failed my custom University Final Project!
